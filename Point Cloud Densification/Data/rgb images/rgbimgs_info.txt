Place all images you want to register onto the point cloud and therefore section of road captured in the image you want to densify in this folder.

Can place as many as you want, though each image (needs to be 2464 × 2056 pixels) will create a 5 million point density point cloud so be wary of storage and computation. 

Skip out every nth row and column if you want a less dense point cloud just before the conversion back to LAS

Should modify code to work for images not of size 2464 × 2056 (should be easy - change the camera internal parameters and some other parts of code)
